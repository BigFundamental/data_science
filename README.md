# Data Science Quantitative Evaluation Toolbox

Welcome to the Data Science Quantitative Evaluation Toolbox! This project provides a comprehensive set of tools for quantitative evaluation in data science roles. It includes implementations of common causal inference methods, such as Propensity Score Matching (PSM), Synthetic Control Method, Difference-in-Differences (DiD), Double DiD, Triple DiD etc. 

## Features

- **Complete Algorithm Implementations**: Full Python implementations of various causal inference methods.
- **Sample Datasets**: Preloaded sample datasets to demonstrate and practice the algorithms.
- **Principle Visualizations**: Visualizations to help understand the principles and results of each method.
- **Research Papers**: References to the original research papers for further reading and in-depth understanding.

## Included Methods

1. **Propensity Score Matching (PSM)**
2. **Synthetic Control Method**
3. **Difference-in-Differences (DiD)**
4. **Double Difference-in-Differences (Double DiD)**
5. **Triple Difference-in-Differences (Triple DiD)**

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed along with the following libraries:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`
- `statsmodels`
- `seaborn`

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib statsmodels seaborn
